    <string name="long_dummy_text">Sexual reproduction in eukaryotes is a process whereby organisms produce offspring that combine genetic traits from both parents.
        Chromosomes are passed on from one generation to the next in this process. Each cell in the offspring has half the chromosomes of the mother and half of the father.[20]
        Genetic traits are contained within the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) of chromosomesâ€”by combining one of each type of chromosomes from each parent, an organism is formed
        containing a doubled set of chromosomes. This double-chromosome stage is called "diploid", while the single-chromosome stage is "haploid". Diploid organisms can, in turn,
        form haploid cells (gametes) that randomly contain one of each of the chromosome pairs, via meiosis.[21] Meiosis also involves a stage of chromosomal crossover, in which
        regions of DNA are exchanged between matched types of chromosomes, to form a new pair of mixed chromosomes. Crossing over and fertilization (the recombining of single sets
        of chromosomes to make a new diploid) result in the new organism containing a different set of genetic traits from either parent.</string>
